Refactor
========
+ Change the dasharray attribute to support NONE as part of the type
+ Add versioning system on every descriptor structure
+ The image element that references a svg is not the same as a use element
  that references a svg. The image must create a self contained document
  thus we must propagate every feature like what eon does
+ Implement every type with reffed values, i.e
typedef struct _Egueb_Svg_Paint
{
	Egueb_Svg_Paint_Type type;
	Egueb_Svg_Color color;
	char *uri;
} Egueb_Svg_Paint;
to
typedef struct _Egueb_Svg_Paint
{
	Egueb_Svg_Paint_Type type;
	Egueb_Svg_Color color;
	Egueb_Dom_String *uri;
} Egueb_Svg_Paint;

  
+ Given that attributes might pass by reference (i.e transfer=none)
  a modification on such value must not be allowed. Otherwise things like
  MyAttrValue v;
  egueb_dom_attr_final_get(attr, &v);
  v.foo = bar
  will not trigger a mutation event ...
  
+ Use the discrete signals for time based events
+ Make the smil timeline/signal be part of the "engine" ns
+ Change the API on the attr_value_set to match the DOM spec
+ When parsing a doc, how to create the nodes using the xmlns
  attribute so we can actually call createElementNS?
+ Remove the attribut_fetch and add the attribute_node_set
+ Add more DOM level 3 functions, element_attribute_set_ns, etc
+ Remove the value function prefix on the macro for attributes. Pass directly the value
+ In case we have a tree like:
  A
  +--- A1
  +--- A2
  +--- A3
       +--- A31
  In case A31 changes but A3 or A is already queued for processing
  do not enqueue A31.
  How to handle it? or we either add a token like "A31" for each node
  so whenever the request process reaches the document check the list
  of already queued elements and see if the token of such elements are
  a subset of the to-be-added node, i.e strstr("A", "A31").
  Another option is to add an event handler on every element so whenever
  a mutatition event passes through element A3 for example, check if A3
  is already queued, if so, do not enqueue A31.

+ Add more functions to attributes implementations, like
  egueb_svg_attr_length_final_get() which will get the parent
  document, the font size, etc, etc and calculate the final value
+ Split every attribute into:
  value_foo, attr_foo, foo
+ Cleanup the feature ui. Just get the input object given
  that we need to replicate lot of API
+ Add the navigation feature, this way document implementations
  can use common definitions for going to a specific URI, going
  back, next, etc.
+ Add an animation context concept, this way we can know whenever
  a set() is the only animation and thus just implement it as a pulse
  otherwise handle the sandwich concept and do as it is right now.
+ Add the document fragment node type. This is helpful for out of
  tree nodes but with the same logic as a document (i.e events)
+ Move the value, the list, even the string implementation to the base
  lib
+ The clip path is by default not inherited unless the inherited
  is set, several presentation attributes work like that, we need
  to fix the initializers of the attr
+ Add a egueb_dom_document_wait_process() which will wait until an enqueued
  process events arrives, in such case, wake up the thread.
+ Modify the clone interface, in order to clone a node we need a doc, just
  create it as it has been parsed
+ Add events whenever an id is inserted/removed

SVG
====
+ There's some complication about attributes and properties and how to export them:
  attributes: object's attributes
  properties: attributes that can be specified with a style and also as object's attributes

  http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2012/03/30/svg-animations-css-animations-css-transitions/
+ On a future we might want to save a svg too, for that case it might be interesting to do
  some research on way to simplify the properties, like simplifying matrices to just
  modifying the inner properties
