EDOM
====
+ The context concept is working correctly but the logic of what tag to accept or tag
  added callback should be done on the Edom_Tag associated with the context

ECSS

ESVG
====
+ There's some complication about attributes and properties and how to export them:
  attributes: object's attributes
  properties: attributes that can be specified with a style and also as object's attributes

+ When changing the inheritance, the container does not make any sense now
+ Add an interface to call whenever the parser can not recognize a property, this way we can easily
  attach a "mouseover" property callback for example, so the upper toolkit library (the one that controls the input) can do something
+ Finsh implementing the paint servers
+ Add a get() method for every property
+ Add a presentation attribute setup (to setup the default value of each attribute)
+ Later we'll need to handle the changed() logic
+ Use pointers for the current/final states so on the boundings we always use the current but it will be witched if it is called after the setup and before the cleanup
+ We need an uri abstraction, someway to know if the uri is local, relative, etc
+ Add a way to parse external/local urls, not only local elements. We better add that function
  to the doc context parser
+ On a future we might want to save a svg too, for that case it might be interesting to do
  some research on way to simplify the properties, like simplifying matrices to just
  modifying the inner properties
